# AreaOptimizationClusteringz
Used for forecasting survey sky area required for reliable clustering-redshift estimation constraints using intensity maps.

Work in progress code to be used as evidence in Optimisation Studies for justifying Clustering-based redshift estimation using HI intensity maps.

Uses maps produced from MICEv2 N-body simulation and relies on methods outlined in https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04498
