# AreaOptimizationClusteringz
Used for forecasting survey sky area required and observation time for reliable clustering-redshift estimation constraints using MeerKAT-like intensity maps.

To be used as evidence in Optimisation Studies for justifying Clustering-based redshift estimation using HI intensity maps.

Uses mock data produced from GAEA semi-analytic simulation (https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04531 & https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.02042.pdf) and relies on methods outlined in https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04498 to produce maps.

Code can run by calling python script AreaOptimisation.py
